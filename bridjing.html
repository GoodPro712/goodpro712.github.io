I feel this is unjustified as I was dueling my friend and my internet started lagging and I was teleporting everywhere. Randomly my internet (I run on mobile hotspot because I cannot afford Wifi) spikes up to anything from 1,000 to 10,000 ping and does not stay this high consistently. During lagging I started building a wing to my opponents goal but got interrupted by getting teleported back to my side of the bridge and getting killed. Me and my friend both mutually voided due to the lag I recieved. After going on the wing, that mind you I thought was real blocks, I had the thought that it could of been a ghost block wing because the same thing has happened before whilst I have been lagging. I tested this with right clicking a block with my pickaxe and it disappeared. I did NOT abuse this factor. I stood on the wing, shift spammed, and messaged my friend in chat. After Psqlm revealed himself for spectating my game, my friend mentioned how I was lagging. After Psqlm banned me, I went to the Discord to share a screenshot of my ban message and, in the heat of the moment, stating how I got false banned. I realize I should not have done this and should have gone straight to the banappeal Discord. After Bridjing saw my message, he banned me from the Discord for 7 days with the message \"ghost block abuse lie to people make us look bad get out\" followed by \"I'm done with five year olds\". I feel this message seemed unfair as all I did was state that I got false banned and post my ban message (which didn't work by the way; my embed failed). Without being in the Discord I had no way to get to the ban appeal server besides asking my friend. To come to the conclusion of me being a lying 5 year old making the Xincraft team look bad from stating that I have been falsely banned seams heavily unjustified.","components":[],"user_id":"550907912281915412","bot":false,"username":"Metacinnabar","nick":"Metacinnabar","tag":"1733","avatar":"92816b4ff838488a4802085b2963f679","id":"892662576599670785","created":1632897743130,"edited":null},{"discordData":{},"attachments":[],"reactions":[],"content":"Being passive aggressive isn’t gonna help you","components":[],"user_id":"782233958036668427","bot":false,"username":"Bridjing","nick":"Bridjing","tag":"0001","avatar":"a_2857d32117557d5dba1dcae683105b85","id":"892791247318712381","created":1632928420620,"edited":null},{"discordData":{},"attachments":[],"reactions":[],"content":"Psqlm saw you five blocks in the air ghost block abusing","components":[],"user_id":"782233958036668427","bot":false,"username":"Bridjing","nick":"Bridjing","tag":"0001","avatar":"a_2857d32117557d5dba1dcae683105b85","id":"892791307033014353","created":1632928434857,"edited":null},{"discordData":{},"attachments":[],"reactions":[],"content":"my guy wrote a fucking essay","components":[],"user_id":"417513231293087744","bot":false,"username":"fruits","nick":"fruits","tag":"1845","avatar":"7ce236126495498ae7c49f59a3acd305","id":"892791462373232640","created":1632928471893,"edited":null},{"discordData":{},"attachments":[],"reactions":[],"content":"to be unbanned on a minecraft server","components":[],"user_id":"417513231293087744","bot":false,"username":"fruits","nick":"fruits","tag":"1845","avatar":"7ce236126495498ae7c49f59a3acd305","id":"892791497693474906","created":1632928480314,"edited":null},{"discordData":{},"attachments":[],"reactions":[],"content":"Lmao","components":[],"user_id":"782233958036668427","bot":false,"username":"Bridjing","nick":"Bridjing","tag":"0001","avatar":"a_2857d32117557d5dba1dcae683105b85","id":"892791549602193428","created":1632928492690,"edited":null},{"discordData":{},"attachments":[],"reactions":[],"content":"You know by appealing like this while trying to lie","components":[],"user_id":"782233958036668427","bot":false,"username":"Bridjing","nick":"Bridjing","tag":"0001","avatar":"a_2857d32117557d5dba1dcae683105b85","id":"892792971118932068","created":1632928831606,"edited":null},{"discordData":{},"attachments":[],"reactions":[],"content":"Your ban has been increas","components":[],"user_id":"782233958036668427","bot":false,"username":"Bridjing","nick":"Bridjing","tag":"0001","avatar":"a_2857d32117557d5dba1dcae683105b85","id":"892792997916327987","created":1632928837995,"edited":null},{"discordData":{},"attachments":[],"reactions":[],"content":"> Being passive aggressive\nThat's not how I intended to come across at all and I apologize if it came across that way.\n> Trying to lie\nThe only thing I'm even being remotely being deceive about is how I wrote in full caps in the Discord. \nI am assuming that Psqlm was not spectating much of my game otherwise they would of seen me lagging, however my opponent did see me lagging, and he did see me on top of a ghost block wing and he didn't see me abusing that fact.
